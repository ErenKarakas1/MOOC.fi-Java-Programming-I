# MOOC.fi-Java-Programming-I
This is a repository of my solutions to Helsinki University's MOOC.fi Java Programming I online course.

### Why did I create this?
1- You can't see the solutions unless you already submitted one, so maybe this can help people who are stuck.
2- I am an actual beginner so my solutions may be easier for you to compare with, unlike the model solutions.
3- New perspectives... I guess.
