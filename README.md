# MOOC.fi-Java-Programming-I
This is a repository of my solutions to Helsinki University's MOOC.fi Java Programming I online course. 
I will be adding solutions as I go.
Why did I create this?
1- You can't see the solutions unless you already submit a solution, so maybe this can help people who are stuck.
2- I am an actual beginner which can make it easier for you to compare solutions unlike the model solutions.
